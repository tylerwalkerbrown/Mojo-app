# Mojo Analysis

## Exploring the Data 

### Costing Summary / Analysis
If you were to choose the all natural route it is going to cost you in the long run:

- Year 2020 it was 36% difference costing around $224 more in dollars. (for naturals)

- Year 2021 it was 66% difference costing around $474 more in dollars. (for naturals)

- Year 2022 it was 59% difference costing around $466 more in dollars. (for naturals)


### Churned Vs Retained Costing Analysis
Going into this I figured that the cost per spray and sum would be different for the retained versus the churned customers but I found out:

Churned:

- The average churned customer spent around 96 per spray summing up to 1162 for the season in dollars for naturals
- The average churned customer spend around 87 per spray summing up to 701 for the season in dollars for synthetic

Retained:

- The average retained customer spent around 104 per spray summing up to 1257 for the season in dollars for naturals
- The average retained customer spend around 98 per spray summing up to 790 for the season in dollars for synthetic

People that go with the natural program churn on average at around 26% compared to 15% churning at a 51% greater rate

### Production Analysis

On average a spray tech makes around $20 per hour. With that number we estimated the amount of return you get per minute depending on the amount billed and the duration of time an employee spends at a property. We found out that on average the comapny will be profiting 4.5 dollars per minute on any given property. Here we have a splot of all the unique square footages that we cover. You can see the 7500 sqft gives us the worst margins. I did do an anaomly detection on this data so I will assusme that 175K sqft properties consisted of some innaccuracte data due to human error.

After year one the company growth was 904.51% then for 2021 to 2022 Mojo experience a 81% growth in revenue

 # Clustering Cost Savings

Once I had a rough estimate of my clusters I had to figure out the total distances between points within the clusters. I also had to factor in the distance it takes to get to the given clusters to start and end the day. 




### Total Distance Formula:

 
Taking in the total distance formula I was able to loop through each given cluster and calculate the distance and using haversine I did each cluster distance from the base of where each tech will depart from. This gave me a basis of distance where I could go in and feature engineer the amount of time that would be spent in the van and the cost of the employee drive time adding in the duration of given properties to get the total route time as well as cost. Giving me this table of aggregates:

 

### Proof of Concept Proof of Value (Cluster Model Results)

To compare both models I had to group by employee and data to get the given (cluster or ) route for the day. Once I had that data I just had to run it though the model getting rid of the kmeans clusters because weâ€™re looking at the old predefined routes. After I had that I took in my suspected routes to see how they compare (based on profit margins). Below is a frequency distribution of 34 randomly sampled days in the historic data and the 34 clusters that I created. You can see that the distribution for the randomly selected days is very spread out compared to the calculated routes. 

 

The average margins for the population of historical data is around 63% compared to the average cluster retuning a 84% margin across the board. This change in routes will yield a 33% boost in production compared to human clustering for routes.
